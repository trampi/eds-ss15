N    * arguments as pointers to the objects to receive the converted input. If
N    * there are insufficient arguments for the format, the behaviour is
N    * undefined. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess
N    * arguments are evaluated but otherwise ignored.
N    * The format is composed of zero or more directives: one or more
N    * white-space characters; an ordinary character (not %); or a conversion
N    * specification. Each conversion specification is introduced by the
N    * character %. For a description of the available conversion specifiers
N    * refer to section 4.9.6.2 in the ANSI draft mentioned at the start of this
N    * file, or to any modern textbook on C.
N    * If end-of-file is encountered during input, conversion is terminated. If
N    * end-of-file occurs before any characters matching the current directive
N    * have been read (other than leading white space, where permitted),
N    * execution of the current directive terminates with an input failure;
N    * otherwise, unless execution of the current directive is terminated with a
N    * matching failure, execution of the following directive (if any) is
N    * terminated with an input failure.
N    * If conversions terminates on a conflicting input character, the offending
N    * input character is left unread in the input strem. Trailing white space
N    * (including new-line characters) is left unread unless matched by a
N    * directive. The success of literal matches and suppressed asignments is
N    * not directly determinable other than via the %n directive.

N    *          even zero, in the event of an early conflict between an input
N    *          character and the format.
